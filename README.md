# Blind Walking Cane – Arduino Based Assistive Device

## Overview
This project is an Arduino-based assistive system designed to help visually impaired users navigate safely.  
The device detects obstacles in the user’s path using sensors and provides real-time alerts, reducing the risk of collisions while walking.

The project was developed as part of an academic course and focuses on practical embedded system design, sensor interfacing, and real-time decision-making.

---

## What This Project Does
- Continuously monitors the surroundings for obstacles
- Detects objects within a predefined distance
- Alerts the user instantly when an obstacle is detected
- Improves walking safety in indoor and outdoor environments

---

## How It Works
1. Sensors mounted on the cane measure the distance to nearby objects.
2. The Arduino processes the sensor data in real time.
3. When an obstacle is detected within a threshold range:
   - An alert (buzzer) is triggered.
4. The process repeats continuously to ensure safe navigation.
